# Where-I-am_Game
Welcome to the game **Where I am** project! This JavaFX application simulates a player moving on a 2D grid based on a set of instructions. It’s a fun way to explore grid-based navigation and validate complex instruction sets.

## Why This Project is Cool
- **Grid-Based Simulation**: Watch how a player moves across a grid based on your instructions.
- **Instruction Validation**: The program checks if the instructions are valid and ensures the player stays within the grid bounds.
- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly interface makes it easy to input instructions and see the results instantly.

## How It Works
1. **Enter Instructions**: Provide a set of commands like `U1L2D6U2R3` (Up 1, Left 2, Down 6, Up 2, Right 3).
2. **Define the Grid**: Specify the number of rows and columns for the grid.
3. **Traverse the Path**: Click the **Traverse the Path** button to see where the player ends up.

## Example
- **Input**: `D2R2U1R1`  
- **Grid**: 3 rows, 4 columns  
- **Output**: `The player is at position 1, 3!`
